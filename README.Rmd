The goal of factory is to make construction of function factories more straightforward, without requiring the user to learn the `rlang` package.

## Installation

Install the released version of factory from CRAN:

```{r cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("factory")
```

Or install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/jonthegeek/factory) with:

```{r dev, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")
```

## Motivation

Function factories are functions that make functions. 
They can be confusing to work with. 
For example, as we'll see below, they can produce functions that are fragile, or that are confusing to work with as a user.

WARNING: All code shown below is "wrong" in some way until we get to the example at the end! These examples show the dangers of working with function factories, and why this package exists.

(examples adapted from [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham (2nd Edition), 10.2.3: Forcing Evaluation](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html#forcing-evaluation))

### The Simplest Factories 

`power1` is a function factory. 
It returns a function based on the `exponent` argument.

```{r power1}
power1 <- function(exponent) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exponent
  }
}
```

For many use cases, `power1` works fine.
For example, we can define a square function by calling power1 with `exponent = 2`.

```{r power1-simple-usage}
square1 <- power1(2)
square1(2)
square1(3)
```

However, `power1` is fragile. 
For example, imagine we defined our square function by referencing a variable defined in the global environment.

```{r power1-fragile}
x <- 2
square1a <- power1(x)
```

If we call `square1a` before `x` changes, it works as expected.

```{r power1-fragile-seems-ok}
square1a(2)
x <- 3
square1a(3)
```

But if `x` changes in-between definition of our function and first call of that function, we get a different result.

```{r power1-fragile-breaks}
x <- 2
square1b <- power1(x)
x <- 3
square1b(2)
square1b(3)
```

This fragility results from `x` being a **promise** in the `square1b` function environment.
Once the promise is evaluated, its value is "fixed," and the function works as expected.

### Forcing arguments

We can make factories that are less fragile, if we remember to `force` the variables.

```{r power2}
power2 <- function(exponent) {
  force(exponent) # Gah, easy to forget!
  function(x) {
    x ^ exponent
  }
}

x <- 2
square2 <- power2(x)
x <- 3
square2(2)
square2(3)
```

However, the resulting function can be hard to understand:

```{r resulting function}
square2
```

It isn't clear what this function will do, since the definition of `exponent` is hidden inside the function's environment.

### Using rlang

We can use {rlang} to make functions that are easier to understand, but building the function factory is much more difficult (from [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham (2nd Edition), 19.7.4: Creating functions](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/quasiquotation.html#new-function)): 

```{r power3}
power3 <- function(exponent) {
  rlang::new_function(
    rlang::exprs(x = ), 
    rlang::expr({
      x ^ !!exponent
    }), 
    rlang::caller_env()
  )
}
```

The resulting functions look like a "normal" function, though, and are thus easier for users to understand:

```{r square3}
square3 <- power3(2)
square3
```


## Enter {factory}

The goal of `factory` is to make function factories as straightforward to create as in `power1`, but to make the resulting functions make as much sense as in `power3`:

```{r power4}
library(factory)
power4 <- build_factory(
  fun = function(x) {
    x ^ exponent
  },
  exponent
)

x <- 2
square4 <- power4(x)
x <- 3
square4(2)
```

The resulting function makes sense, as with power3:

```{r square4}
square4
```
